# Introduction of the Data and Data Access

## Introduction of the Data

Our lab member, Wang, implemented the crawler by using Twitchâ€™s API and VPN server to collect the CDN data from different regions. The crawler chose the top K channels that account for 80% of the total viewers.

The data is stored in MongoDB, and the dataset in MongoDB is divided into several collections that each represent VPN servers in one country. 

In my research, I picked the data from 'United_States', 'United_Kingdom', 'France', 'Netherlands', and 'Germany', which have larger data sizes than those from other countries.

## Data Access
1. Use SSH to connect to the server, "140.112.42.161".
2. Change the variable 'loc' in 'load_csv.py' to the data you want to choose. (The option of locations is shown below. [note 1]) 
3. Run 'load_csv.py'
4. The program, 'load_csv.py', will create the data file as, './dataset/{loc}.csv'.

[note 1]
location = 'Taiwan', 'Russian', 'Brazil', 'Ukraine', 'South_Korea', 'Spain', 'United_Kingdom', 'Canada', 'France', 'Netherlands', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'Denmark', 'Poland', 'Sweden', 'Italy', 'Turkey', 'United_States', 'SouthKorea'

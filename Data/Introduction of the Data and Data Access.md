# Introduction of the Data and Data Access

## Introduction of the Data

Our lab member, Wang, implemented the crawler by using Twitchâ€™s API and VPN server to collect the CDN data from different regions. The crawler chose the top K channels that account for 80% of the total viewers.

The data is stored in MongoDB, and the dataset in MongoDB is divided into several collections that each represent VPN servers in one country. 

In my research, I picked data from 'United_States', 'United_Kingdom', 'France', 'Netherlands', and 'Germany', which have larger data sizes than those from other countries.

## Data Access
1. Use PuTTY to connect to the server, "nslab@140.112.42.161".
2. cd to the folder, '~/Desktop/Data-Analysis-for-Twitch-CDN/Data'
3. Change 'United_States' in the below code in 'load_csv.py' to the data you want to collect. [Note 1]
```
for x in db.United_States.find():
```
5. Also, change the variable 'loc' in 'load_csv.py' to the data you want to collect. 
6. Run 'load_csv.py'
7. The program, 'load_csv.py', will create the data file as, './{loc}.csv'.
8. Use the below SCP command to get the data from the remote server to the local.
```
scp nslab@140.112.42.161:~/Desktop/Data-Analysis-for-Twitch-CDN/Data/{loc}.csv
```


Note
1. The option of locations is shown below.\
location = 'Taiwan', 'Russian', 'Brazil', 'Ukraine', 'South_Korea', 'Spain', 'United_Kingdom', 'Canada', 'France', 'Netherlands', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'Denmark', 'Poland', 'Sweden', 'Italy', 'Turkey', 'United_States', 'SouthKorea'
2. The data of United_States (us.csv), United_Kingdom, France, Netherlands, and Germany are already in the remote machine.\
One can directly download the data from the folder, nslab@140.112.42.161:~/Desktop/Data-Analysis-for-Twitch-CDN/Data

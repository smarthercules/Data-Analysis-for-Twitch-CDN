## Absract
Data analysis for CDN server population estimation based on CMR model with heterogeneity

## Complete Video Demonstration
1. Get the data
2. Run CJS model in chapter 5
3. Run .ipynb files for each chapter

## Structure

### ./Presentation: 
My thesis oral presentation, including .pdf file and .ppt file.

### ./Thesis:
The file of my thesis, including .pdf file and latex source file.

### ./Data:
The .md file introduces the Twitch's dataset and data access. One need to follow the instruction to get the data.

### ./Program:
The code I used in my thesis, including .ipynb file and code for the CJS model.
  iPython files (.ipynb): how to get the results of the corresponding chapter in my thesis.
  ./ch5_CJS_Estimation_Error: code and script for runnung the CJS model with clustering results.

### ./Result:
The CJS results of the experiment in my thesis. 
It is divided into p0_cluster_result, p1_capture_history, R_capture_probability, p2_daily_plot, and p2_est_result.

(1) p0_cluster_result: The clustering results I generated by k-means or other algorithms.

(2) p1_capture_history: The capture history for each server. This file is for the input to CJS.R.

(3) R_capture_probability: The capture probability and survival rate caculate by the CJS.R.

(4) p2_daily_plot: The plot of baseline and estimation number of servers on every date.

(5) p2_est_result: The estimation error rate, standard deviation, and the runtime of the CJS model.

### ./Readme:

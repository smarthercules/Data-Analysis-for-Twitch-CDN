# CJS Model

## Introduction

In the chapter 5, 6, and 7 of my thesis, I deploy the clustering results to MLE based CJS model. We use the package "marked" in r.
We divide the code into 3 phase, kmeans_phase1.py, CJS.R, cheng_kmeans_phase1.py.
And run codes on the remote machine, "140.112.42.161".

## Deploy Method
### ch5.1 Preliminaries
Run the .sh files in the folder to generate the estimation results of the CJS model.\
The estimation error rate will show on the terminal.\
Besides, the estimation result will save as "p2_est_result_sample_hour_{smaple_hour}.txt", and the plot of estimation number and baseline will save as "p2_daily_plot_sample_hour_{smaple_hour}.png"

### ch5.2 Multiple_KMeans


### ch6.2 ~ ch6.
